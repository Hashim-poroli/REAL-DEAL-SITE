                        <option value="">There are individuals who choose to repaint their homes upon purchase to modify the color scheme, while others opt for a fresh coat of paint before listing their property for sale to improve its exterior attractiveness. However, it's typical to repaint one's home every 5-10 years or every 4-7 years if it has a stained finish. Houses located near the sea usually require more frequent painting due to the corrosive sea breeze. Several elements, such as the level of preparation carried out previously (including sanding and scraping) and the grade of the paint selected, play a role in determining how long the paint lasts.
                            In the case of stained surfaces, it's noticeable when the wood starts drying. Paint may also become chalky or lose its vibrance due to prolonged exposure to sunlight. Inferior paint with sparse pigment can manifest uneven tones based on how sunlight hits it. It is advisable to repaint stucco every 5-7 years; failure to do so can lead to cracks or chunks falling off. A good number of homeowners adopt a regimen of repainting every 5-7 years, likening it to changing a vehicle's oil, to avert potential damage.</option>

                        <option value="">In preparation for interior painting, we advise to relocate small and fragile items. If you feel confident in handling them yourself, you may consider taking down pictures or mirrors from the walls. For heavier objects that cannot be easily moved, our team will take care of moving them. We will also ensure thorough coverage of everything using plastic sheets and tarps. As for exterior painting, it is recommended to move small items such as potted plants away from the house. If you have window-based air conditioning units, it is preferable to bring them indoors. If assistance is needed, we are more than happy to help. We also recommend that you park your car away from your house and that you provide access to hose water for our use.</option>

                        <option value="">Typically, exterior paint reaches a dry-to-touch state within approximately two hours of application. However, it is essential to allow a minimum of four hours of drying time before applying a recoat. On the other hand, interior paint generally dries to the touch within an hour or two after application.</option>

                        <option value="">The longevity of paint and stain on surfaces is influenced by various factors such as climate, sun exposure, and the quality of preparation. When the surface has undergone proper preparation, including thorough sanding and caulking, and is free from rot and gutter issues, the application of high-quality paint can typically provide a lasting finish of around 8 to 10 years. Stain, on the other hand, presents a slightly more complex situation as its durability depends on factors like sun exposure, climate, and the darkness of the stain. Generally, stain can endure anywhere between 4 to 12 years.</option>
